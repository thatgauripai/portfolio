        <p>
          My school days were filled with both academic learning and vibrant co-curricular involvement. I actively participated in <strong>Model United Nations (MUNs)</strong>, youth parliaments, and literary fests that helped me develop strong communication, public speaking, and critical thinking skills. These events not only shaped my confidence but also exposed me to different perspectives and ideas from a young age.
